            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This part of <hi>New-England</hi> began firſt to be planted about the ſame time with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginia, viz.</hi> in the year 1606. There the firſt <hi>Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> granted by the King for the Limitation of <hi>Virginia,</hi> did extend from 34 to 44 Degrees of <hi>North Latitude,</hi> and was divided into two parts, namely the firſt, and the ſecond <hi>Colony;</hi> The former was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the City of <hi>London,</hi> The other, to the Cities of <hi>Briſtol, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter,</hi> and Town of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> each of which had <hi>Laws, Priviledges,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> for the Government, and advancing their ſeveral Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alike, As ſaith, <hi>Capt. Smith</hi> in his general Hiſtory of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and <hi>New-England.</hi> This ſecond <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> promiſing but little Advantage to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers,</hi> by reaſon of its <hi>Mountainous</hi> and <hi>Rocky Scituation,</hi> found but few <hi>Adventurers</hi> forward to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the planting thereof, after the death of Sir <hi>John Popham,</hi> who was the firſt that ever procured men, or means to poſſeſs it; for when the main Pillars are removed, what can be expected but that the whole building ſhould fall to the ground. Yet, notwithſtanding the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements the firſt <hi>Planters</hi> met withal in their firſt <hi>Winter ſeaſoning,</hi> in that <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>rocky deſert</hi> (which made them all return home in the year 1608) did Sir <hi>Francis Popham</hi> his Son, having the Ships and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which remained of the Company, and ſupplying what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for his purpoſe, ſend divers times to the <hi>Coaſts</hi> for <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Fiſhing,</hi> of whoſe loſs or gain, as ſaith my <hi>Author,</hi> himſelf was beſt able to give account. And ſome of the Ships ſent by him, and the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Southhampton,</hi> with other <hi>Noble Adventurers,</hi> did bring home ſome of the Natives of the place in one of the next following years, by whoſe Informations, ſome of the firſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers</hi> were encouraged once more to try the verity of their hopes, and ſee if poſſibly they might finde ſomething that could enduce a freſh <hi>Reſolution</hi> to proſecute ſo <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>Honourable</hi> a work.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time before there was yet any Speech, or endeavour to ſettle any other Plantation in thoſe parts, That about <hi>Saga de hook</hi> being thus abandoned for the preſent by the firſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers,</hi> The <hi>Frenchmen</hi> immediately took the opportunity to ſettle themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our <hi>Limits,</hi> which being underſtood by thoſe of <hi>Virginia,</hi> they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly taking into their conſideration the inconveniences that might ariſe by ſuffering them to harbour there, Sir <hi>Samuel Argal</hi> was ſent with Commiſſion to diſplace them, which he with <hi>great diſcretion, de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Judgement</hi> performed about the year 1613. The which made way for the Plantation at <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> granted afterwards by <hi>King James</hi> to <hi>Sir William Alexander</hi> one of his <hi>Majeſties moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Council of</hi> Scotland. The ſaid <hi>Argal</hi> ſeized the <hi>Forts</hi> which the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> had built at <hi>Mount Manſel,</hi> St. <hi>Croix,</hi> and <hi>Port Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> and carried away their <hi>Ordnance,</hi> with other <hi>Proviſions</hi> to the <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of <hi>Virginia,</hi> to their great Benefit. The ſaid places were held by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> divers years after, till about the <hi>year 1635.</hi> by Commiſſion from the <hi>Scotch Lord</hi> aforeſaid, but how his right came afterwards to be <hi>alienated</hi> to any of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, doth not concern us with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the buſineſs in hand, further to enquire.</p>
            <p>Things remaining in this poſture for the ſpace of near <hi>ſeven years,</hi> ſome of the firſt Adventurers apprehenſive of better hopes of good that might enſue by a freſh Attempt, Reſolved to ſet the deſigne a foot a <hi>ſecond time,</hi> to which End ſeveral Ships were ſent on that account in the <hi>year 1615.</hi> but with as bad Succeſs as the former; for in the year before, <hi>viz. 1614. Capt. Smith</hi> deſirous to promote the <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Virginia</hi> came thither with <hi>two Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> and returned back to <hi>England</hi> in the leſſer of them, with intent to be there again that next year, to promote the ſaid Plantation; But after he was gone, one <hi>Thomas Hunt</hi> maſter of the Ship, he left behind, like a <hi>wicked Varlot,</hi> to prevent the carrying on the Plantation, that he &amp; a few <hi>Merchants</hi> might wholly enjoy the benefit of the <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>Country,</hi> after he had made his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oyage,</hi> ſeized upon <hi>four &amp; twenty</hi> of the <hi>poor Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Natives,</hi> that in confidence of his honeſty, had put themſelves into his hands, then <hi>clapping them under Hatches,</hi> carryed them away to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lego,</hi> whither he was <hi>bound</hi> with the fiſh he had made upon the <hi>Coaſt,</hi> for that <hi>Market:</hi> But this <hi>vile act,</hi> although it kept him for ever after from any more imployment in thoſe parts, yet that was the leaſt part of the miſchief that attended his <hi>wicked practice;</hi> for upon the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> of the <hi>Adventurers</hi> Ships the <hi>next yeare;</hi> Two Natives of the place that had been ſome years in <hi>England,</hi> and coming back unto the ſaid Ships, as ſoon as they underſtood the iniury ſo <hi>Treacherouſly done</hi> to their <hi>Country men,</hi> they contracted ſuch an hatred againſt our whole Nation, that although one of the ſaid Natives dyed ſoon after, yet the other called <hi>Epenow,</hi> ſtudied how to be Revenged, which he ſo far found means to Effect, that he <hi>frustrated this ſecond Attempt</hi> of ſetling a Plantation in theſe parts.</p>
            <p>Yet did not the Adventurers caſt off all hope of carrying on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, wherein Providence within a few years after ſo <hi>favoured them,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:171789:4"/>
that one or more of the Salvages called <hi>Tiſquamtum and Samoſet,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away by <hi>Hunt,</hi> was brought back to <hi>New-found Land,</hi> from whence he was ſoon after conveyed by the prudent endeavour of <hi>Capt. Maſon</hi> (then Governour of the Plantation begun upon <hi>New-found Land</hi>) into the hands of ſome of the <hi>Adventurers</hi> by whoſe means they hoped to <hi>work a peace</hi> betwixt the ſaid Natives on that <hi>Coaſt</hi> where the <hi>fire had been kindled before;</hi> for the <hi>Adventurers</hi> imployed <hi>Capt. Thomas Darmer,</hi> a <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>induſtrious Gentleman</hi> to ſettle the affairs of the Plantation, now a third time revived again about <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibeck,</hi> in the <hi>year 1619,</hi> or thereabouts. By his prudence and care a laſting peace was made betwixt the Natives of the place, and the Engliſh, who were but a little before ſo abhorred by them, for the wrong formerly received, ſo as the Plantation began at laſt to <hi>proſper,</hi> and <hi>continue in good liking,</hi> and <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of the <hi>Friendſhip</hi> of their Neighbours, that had been lately ſo exaſperated againſt them. This <hi>Tisquantum</hi> forementioned, was not a little Inſtrumental, and helpful to the Plantation begun at <hi>New Plimouth</hi> about the following <hi>year, viz. 1620.</hi> in their weak beginnings, there being frequent mention of his Name, as alſo of one <hi>Samoſet,</hi> a Native of the ſame place, by the like Providence brought back to <hi>Kennibeck,</hi> and from thence with <hi>Tiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quantum</hi> came to the New-planters at <hi>Patuxet,</hi> or <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and brought them into acquaintance with <hi>Maſſaſoit,</hi> the great <hi>Sachem</hi> about thoſe parts; without whoſe Friendſhip that new Plantation would hardly have ſubſiſted long.</p>
            <p>This Story premiſed is the more to be minded in this place, becauſe the Friendſhip upon the means and occaſions aforeſaid, confirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Indians</hi> in theſe <hi>Eaſtern parts,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> had continued <hi>ſtedfaſt and Conſtant to this year,</hi> when it was broken by <hi>another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous</hi> and <hi>wicked practice,</hi> of a like nature, and parrallel to that of the foreſaid <hi>Hunt.</hi> As may more fully be declared afterwards.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly the like ſacisfaction may prove the more probable means to procure a ſetled peace. But to return, whence this Digreſſion hath been made. Some years were ſpent to bring things to this Iſſue: The <hi>Adventurers</hi> were put to much care and pains before they could get their Patent <hi>confirmed,</hi> and <hi>Renewed again;</hi> many <hi>Obſtructions</hi> they met withal from ſome <hi>Interlopers</hi> that began to look into the <hi>Trade</hi> of this <hi>Country,</hi> and would <hi>irregularly</hi> have had a <hi>ſhare therein,</hi> or made it <hi>common</hi> to all <hi>Traders,</hi> to which End they <hi>petitioned</hi> to a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> then called, to bring about their Ends, but at the laſt it was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led firmly in the hands of ſundry Noble and worthy Patentees, <hi>Lords,

Knights, Gentlemen,</hi> and <hi>Merchants,</hi> commonly known by the Name of the <hi>Councel of</hi> Plimouth, who had the <hi>abſolute power</hi> under the <hi>King,</hi> for making all <hi>Grants,</hi> and <hi>diſpoſing of all Lands</hi> from the 40th. to the 48th. <hi>Degrees of North Latitude;</hi> All which was accompliſhed about the <hi>year 1621.</hi> Some printed Relations that ſpeak of theſe <hi>Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> write much of the flouriſhing ſtate, and hopeful proſperity of this Plantation, publiſhed about <hi>forty or fifty years ſince,</hi> yet did it never appear by what followed, that any <hi>conſiderable Advantage</hi> did ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to the <hi>firſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers</hi> from this their New-Plantation of the <hi>Eastern parts,</hi> unleſs by the Trade of <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and <hi>Furrs,</hi> which latter continued not long; As for the <hi>former,</hi> The chief benefit redounded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them that <hi>managed</hi> it by their own <hi>particular Stocks,</hi> and <hi>perſonal Endeavours:</hi> And if without offence it may be ſpoken, the multitude of Patents ſoon after granted to ſeveral <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of <hi>Broken Fortunes,</hi> have provided but places of an <hi>Honourable Exile</hi> or <hi>Confinement,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many deſerving perſons of better Education then Fortune, were ſent to ſhift for themſelves in a <hi>Forreign Land,</hi> without being further Troubleſome to thoſe nearer home, on whom they had their <hi>hopes and Dependance;</hi> yet it muſt not be denyed but that ſome of the <hi>

The Reaſon of which is not hard to give, in Reference to all thoſe Lands and Territories that lye to the Eaſtward of <hi>Paſcataqua River.</hi> One main Cauſe hath been the multiplicity of Grants and Patents for the dividing of the ſaid <hi>Tract of Land,</hi> for beſide the ſtrife that hath been occaſioned by the Intricacy and indiſtinctneſs of their Liberties and Bounds, (enough to have maintained a greater number of Lawyers, then ever were the Inhabitants) If the Grantees had been ſupplyed with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes proportionable to their writts and Controverſies about their bounds and Jurisdictions, which ſometimes they have been ready to decide with their Swords, witneſs thoſe fatal Names impoſed on ſuch Accounts upon ſome places belonging to thoſe parts, as <hi>Bloody point, Black and Blew point,</hi> and every conſiderable <hi>Parcel of Land</hi> being by <hi>Patent</hi> granted to ſeveral particular perſons, hindred the <hi>erecting of Town-ſhips</hi> and <hi>Villages,</hi> which if it had been otherwiſe diſpoſed of, might have been full of <hi>Towns,</hi> and <hi>well peopled,</hi> and thereby the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants had been able to have <hi>stood upon their Guard,</hi> and <hi>defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> againſt the <hi>common Enemy,</hi> whereas now they were but like <hi>ſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae diſſolutae,</hi> or like his <hi>Arrows</hi> that being bound up in one bundle could not be broken by an ordinary Force, but being looſe, were eaſily <hi>ſnapt

aſunder,</hi> by any ſingle hand. Another Reaſon might be, the imploying of ſuch <hi>Agents</hi> &amp; <hi>Inſtruments</hi> as either wanted <hi>Skill or Fidelity</hi> to manage what they were <hi>betruſted with,</hi> which made many of the <hi>Adventurers</hi> long ago complain, that (in ſtead of <hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> &amp; other Returns which they expected) they received nothng but large <hi>Inventoryes</hi> of the wants of their ſeveral Plantations, and the Servants ſent over to improve them, which were all the Returns that many of them ever received for the large <hi>Summs of mony</hi> many diſburſed for the carrying on their affairs A third Reaſon may be the ſeveral Changes of Government the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have paſſed under, which have occaſioned not only much <hi>vexation,</hi> &amp; <hi>Expences</hi> to ſuch as were upon the place; but much diſcouragement to ſeveral others, who by the <hi>commodiouſneſs of the Soyle,</hi> would willingly have choſen Station in thoſe parts, had they ſeen any hope of <hi>a ſetled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> ever like to have been obtained; which is not hard to <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> by giving a little touch as we paſs along, on the ſeveral <hi>changes of Government,</hi> the places forementioned have been <hi>moulded into,</hi> &amp; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Proprietours</hi> of, have claimed Intereſt in the Land.

he being denyed opportunity to Effect it, as alſo a Ship formerly ſent by the <hi>Patentees</hi> for that End, not accompliſhing their deſire, they not long after ſold all their Intereſt in the ſaid Patent, to one <hi>Mr. Rigby</hi> a <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Gentleman, who made <hi>Mr. Cleaves</hi> his <hi>Agent</hi> to manage the buſineſs of his purchaſed Intereſt in the ſaid Patent; To whom Mr. <hi>Dummer</hi> was ordered to deliver the <hi>Original Patent,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did: what trouble was occaſioned ſoon after between the ſaid <hi>Mr. Cleaves</hi> and Mr. <hi>

            <p>In the <hi>year 1632. Sir Ferdinando Gorges</hi> not reſting in the joynt Patent obtained for himſelf, and <hi>Capt.

But it is now time to begin with the particulars of the <hi>Tragedy</hi> it ſelf, that the Reader account not the <hi>Prologue</hi> too long. It was on the 24th. of <hi>June</hi> 1675. when the firſt miſchief was done by the <hi>Indians</hi> about <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> before <hi>twenty dayes</hi> were over, the fire began to kindle in theſe the <hi>moſt remote</hi> &amp; moſt <hi>Northerly bounds</hi> of the ſaid Country, or <hi>two hundred &amp; fifty</hi> miles diſtance, &amp; upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; <hi>July the</hi> 11th. <hi>1675.</hi> A Letter was brought to <hi>Kennibeck</hi> from one <hi>Henry Sawyer</hi> an Inhabitant of <hi>Yorke,</hi> ſignifying the <hi>news of the Indians ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> about <hi>Plimouth,</hi> &amp; that a courſe was taken to <hi>diſarm the indians</hi> along the ſhore. This rumour did ſo far <hi>awaken the Inhabitants</hi> of thoſe parts that the very next day at a <hi>general meeting</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at one <hi>Capt. Pattiſbals bouſe,</hi> ſeveral offered themſelves as <hi>Voluntiers,</hi> to go up the ſaid River of <hi>Kennibeck,</hi> to make diſcovery of the <hi>Indians Fidelity,</hi> or elſe to fight them, if occaſion were. The third day after, marching up the River to <hi>Quegeſeck,</hi> they met with the Inhabitants of <hi>Ships Cot River,</hi> which is a River lying about twelve or fourteen miles to the <hi>North East of Kenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck.</hi> Divers of the Indians thereabouts, by the perſwaſions of one <hi>Mr. Walker,</hi> that uſed to trade with them, brought down an <hi>inconſiderable part of their Amunition,</hi> as a few <hi>Guns,</hi> a little <hi>Powder</hi> &amp; <hi>Shot,</hi> with a few <hi>knives:</hi> About ſeven of the <hi>Kennibeck Indians,</hi> &amp; five of thoſe called <hi>Ammoſcog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Indians,</hi> about <hi>Pegypscot,</hi> (a river more <hi>Southward</hi> toward <hi>Caſco</hi>) made this ſhew of bringing in their Arms <hi>Capt. Lake, Capt. Partiſhal,</hi> with <hi>Mr. Wiswal,</hi> in whoſe hands was ſetled a kind of <hi>military power</hi> for thoſe <hi>parts,</hi> were ſent for to examine the ſaid <hi>Indians</hi> further, of whom upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation they ſaw Reaſon to <hi>ſuſpect ſome,</hi> if not all, whereupon they ſent Meſſengers the ſecond time to the <hi>Ammoſcogging Indians;</hi> &amp; alſo a Letter to <hi>Mr. Walker,</hi> to ſend down <hi>their Arms</hi> and <hi>Amunition</hi> to them for their greater Security. After Mr. <hi>Wiswal</hi> was returned home, the five <hi>Ammoscogging Indians</hi> aforeſaid brought in their <hi>Guns,</hi> but with no good intent probably; for an Indian called <hi>Sowen,</hi> having an Axe in his hand, ſtruck at one <hi>Hoſea Malier</hi> a <hi>French man,</hi> but was prevented
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:171789:8"/>
from doing him miſchief, however the ſaid Indian was preſently <hi>bound</hi> and put into a <hi>Cellar.</hi> Some of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that uſed to Trade with thoſe Indians were ready to excuſe the Indian, ſaying he was <hi>drunke,</hi> or that he was a <hi>diſtracted Fellow,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Wiswall</hi> with the other two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminants, lookt upon thoſe as meer Excuſes, and altogether groundleſs, for one of them to this day affirms, that he was as <hi>Rational and ſenſible</hi> as any of the reſt.</p>
            <p>The ancient Indians being asked what they thought was meet to be done in the ſaid Caſe, ſaid, he was <hi>worthy to dye</hi> for ſuch an <hi>affront,</hi> yet they would be glad if his life might be ſpared, offering to be <hi>joyntly bound</hi> in his behalf, to pay <hi>forty Beaver Skins</hi> at the next <hi>Fall-Voyage,</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hands in token of their <hi>Fidelity,</hi> and alſo leaving their Arms in the hands of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as a Pledge of their <hi>faithful keeping thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Peace</hi> concluded on betwixt them. If they proved themſelves honeſt men, they were to have their Arms delivered them again, which was accordingly performed the laſt <hi>June,</hi> 1676. They having in the mean time carried themſelves peaceably toward the Engliſh. The day after, <hi>viz. July 19.</hi> 1675. An Indian of great note amongſt them, called <hi>Robin hood</hi> with great Applauſe of the reſt, made a <hi>dance,</hi> and <hi>ſung a Song</hi> to declare their content in what was transacted. And ſo they parted, ſetting the Indians at liberty, that had engaged thus for their friend <hi>Sowen,</hi> the Indian; but yet to this day <hi>one Skin of Beaver</hi> was never paid to the Engliſh, as was promiſed; The Indians all this time were well provided for of victuals by <hi>Capt. Lake,</hi> with other ſupplies of <hi>Rhum</hi> and <hi>Tobacco,</hi> even to the <hi>diſguſting</hi> of ſome Engliſh then preſent.</p>
            <p>But the Indians left as <hi>Hoſtages</hi> upon <hi>Sowens</hi> account, how Civilly ſoever they were treated, ran all away at the laſt, truſting more to the <hi>Celerity of their own feet,</hi> then to the <hi>Civility of their Engliſh Friends;</hi> who after they were eſcaped, joyned with a parcel of their Fellows ſoon after about twenty in all, in <hi>robbing the houſe</hi> of one Mr. <hi>Purchaſe</hi> an antient Planter about <hi>Pegypscot River,</hi> and a known Trader with the Indians, what ever wrong may be pretended by the ſaid Indians, as done them in <hi>their Trading,</hi> (of which more may be ſpoken afterwards) that will no whit excuſe their <hi>perfidious Treachery,</hi> and <hi>falſhood</hi> in <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant</hi> with the Engliſh, diſſembling, and ſeeking all Advantages of Cruelty againſt their Engliſh Neighbours, of which in the following <hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>Summer,</hi> 1676. there will be a more full and undenyable diſcovery. This was done in the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> 1675. Thoſe Indians that firſt aſſaulted Mr. <hi>Purchaſe his houſe,</hi> did no other miſchief,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:171789:8"/>
ſave <hi>plundering it of strong Liquor,</hi> and <hi>Amunition,</hi> alſo killing a Calf or two, with a few Sheep, but no more then what they eat, and ſpoyling a <hi>Feather bed</hi> by ripping it open, to turn out the Feathers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themſelves with the Caſe, which they might more eaſily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away. They offered no incivility to the <hi>Miſtreſs of the houſe,</hi> (her husband, and her Sons, being at that time <hi>from home</hi>) yet one of her Sons approaching near the houſe, and finding it poſſeſſed of thoſe new Inhabitants, he rode away with all ſpeed, and yet no faſter then there was need; for an Indian followed him with a <hi>Gun under his Coat,</hi> to have <hi>ſhot at him,</hi> if he could by his <hi>flattery,</hi> and <hi>diſſembling,</hi> have got him within the reach of his <hi>Piece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid, that at the firſt they uſed fair words, and ſpake of Trading, but as they went away, told thoſe of the houſe, that there were others coming after that would deal far worſe with them, which within a ſhort time after came to paſs, for theſe were but the <hi>meſſengers of Death,</hi> which was ſoon after inflicted, and that in a <hi>moſt Barbarous manner</hi> upon ſundry Inhabitants of the <hi>Neighbouring Plantations.</hi>

            <p>Much about the ſame time, five perſons going up to the River of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> were all killed by the ſame Indians.</p>
            <p>Theſe Tragedies being thus acted at <hi>Caſco Bay,</hi> and <hi>Saco,</hi> thoſe Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Enemies diſperſed themſelves in parties, intending to do all the miſchief they could to all the Engliſh, inhabiting about that ſide of the Country; In the ſame Month of <hi>September</hi> they came down towards <hi>Paſcataqua,</hi> doing the like Spoyle upon the Inhabitants of the ſeveral Branches of that River, which they had been doing elſewhere; In the firſt place they burned the two <hi>Cheſlyes</hi> houſes about <hi>Oyſter River,</hi> and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led two men that were paſſing along the River in a <hi>Canoo;</hi> and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way an old Iriſh-man, with a young man taken from about <hi>Exceter,</hi> who yet both of them ſoon after made an eſcape to a Garriſon at <hi>Salmon-Falls</hi> in <hi>Kittary</hi> by the help of an Indian better minded then the reſt, the firſt after <hi>ſeven weeks,</hi> the other after a Months Captivity.</p>
            <p>Much about that time, one Goodman <hi>Robinſon</hi> of <hi>Exceter</hi> with his Son were travelling toward <hi>Hampton,</hi> where, as they paſſed along, they were <hi>way-laid</hi> by <hi>three Indians, viz.

            <p>The next day toward night more of the <hi>Barbarous Enemies</hi> being <hi>gathdred together</hi> they made <hi>another Aſſault</hi> upon the <hi>neighbouring dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Engliſh, as many as could be ſpared out of the <hi>Garriſon,</hi> (not above <hi>eight</hi> in number) purſued after them about <hi>half a mile,</hi> but night coming on, it was judged beſt <hi>to retreat,</hi> leſt otherwiſe they might have been <hi>Intercepted</hi> in their return home, by any of them <hi>lying in Ambuſh,</hi> which is their uſual way of <hi>doing miſchief.</hi> After divers ſhot made on <hi>both ſides,</hi> but <hi>five</hi> of the Enemies appeared: who yet took the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>Captain Wincals</hi> abſence, (whoſe dwelling was not far off) to <hi>burne his houſe and Barne,</hi> with another <hi>houſe,</hi> and <hi>two Barns</hi> more, wherein was much <hi>Engliſh Corn;</hi> above an <hi>hundred Buſhels</hi> was ſuppoſed to be in one of them.

            <p>The next day after, the ſame <hi>Indians,</hi> or others of their <hi>Fellows,</hi> came upon the other ſide of the River, from whence they <hi>ſhot over ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times,</hi> to ſome that were <hi>grinding in the Mill,</hi> but after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing of many <hi>ſhot</hi> on <hi>both ſides of the River,</hi> betwixt them, <hi>ſix of the Enemy</hi> ſhewed themſelves in the <hi>Twilight,</hi> uttering ſeveral <hi>Inſolent</hi> and <hi>barbarous Speeches</hi> calling our men <hi>Engliſh dogs,</hi> &amp;c. yet all this while out of reach of their <hi>ſhot,</hi> and then they ran all away <hi>like dogs after they had done barking.</hi>

            <p>After this, thoſe very Indians, as was ſuppoſed, burned <hi>five or ſix houſes</hi> about <hi>Oyſter River,</hi> and killed <hi>two men, viz.</hi> one <hi>William Roberts</hi> and his <hi>Son in Law.</hi> The Inhabitants of <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Corn in the Field while the reſt of them were buſied in <hi>beating of an Oven</hi> to bake ſome of the fruit which they gathered alſo in the ſame Field.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh were at ſuch a diſtance that they could not make <hi>any ſign</hi> to their <hi>Fellows,</hi> without being diſcovered by the Indians in the Field; wherefore <hi>two of them crept</hi> as near as they could to <hi>the houſe,</hi> at one end of <hi>the Field,</hi> where they <hi>ſuddenly ruſhed</hi> upon <hi>two of the wretches,</hi> and <hi>knocked them down</hi> with the Butt end of their Muskets, which was not done ſo <hi>ſilently,</hi> but the other <hi>three in the Field</hi> took the <hi>Alarm,</hi> and fled away, who elſe might as eaſily have been <hi>ſurprized as</hi> the other two.</p>
            <p>Theſe Outrages thus daily committed, <hi>filled all the Plantations</hi> about <hi>Paſcataqua</hi> with <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>confuſion;</hi> ſcarce any place, where there was not either <hi>Reaſon for ſome to complain</hi> of <hi>the loſs of their Friends,</hi> or <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their houſes;</hi> which cauſed moſt of them that lived <hi>ſcatteringly,</hi> at any diſtance from <hi>Neighbours,</hi> either to <hi>garriſon</hi> their houſes, or elſe to <hi>deſert their own dwellings,</hi> and to <hi>repair</hi> to their next <hi>Neighbours</hi> that were <hi>better fortified</hi> then themſelves; But all the Inhabitants in thoſe parts in general, were Alarmed to ſtand upon their Guard.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>ſeventh</hi> of <hi>October</hi> following, being a day of <hi>publick Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> a man was <hi>ſhot down</hi> as he was riding between <hi>two garriſon houſes</hi> about <hi>Newechewannick,</hi> and <hi>dyed of his wounds</hi> within <hi>two hours</hi> after; About the ſame inſtant of time <hi>two young men</hi> were <hi>ſhot dead</hi> about a mile from that place; Theſe two had their Arms or Guns with them, which were carryed away by them that <hi>killed them,</hi> together with their <hi>upper garments;</hi> It is not ſaid that theſe three laſt, (though killed upon a <hi>day of Humiliation</hi>) were <hi>ſurprized</hi> in their <hi>repairing</hi> to, or <hi>retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> from the place of <hi>publick worſhip,</hi> which would in a great meaſure have abated the <hi>ſorrow of their ſad Funerals,</hi> if when they were <hi>ſuddenly arrested by the Harbingers of Death,</hi> they had been found ſo doing.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, they Aſſaulted another <hi>houſe</hi> at <hi>Oyſter River,</hi> the which, although it was garriſoned, yet meeting with a <hi>good old man,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Beard</hi> without the Garriſon, they killed him upon the place, and in a <hi>barbarons manner cut off his head,</hi> and <hi>ſet it upon a Pole in deriſion,</hi> not far off about the ſame time <hi>they burned another houſe and Barne.</hi>

            <p>Further alſo it is affirmed by ſome perſons <hi>worthy of Credit,</hi> that for divers years paſt have lived in thoſe parts, that the Indians thereabouts, need not have wanted <hi>powder</hi> or <hi>ſhot,</hi> only they wanted ſomething wherewith to <hi>cloak their malitious and barbarous practices</hi> of late com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt us; but there being different opinions about this point, we ſhall leave it at the preſent.</p>
            <p>But this being premiſed in Reference to the pretended ground, or occaſion of the <hi>quarrel;</hi> It remains that the Effects thereof, be now related.</p>
            <p>Before the <hi>Warre</hi> with <hi>Philip</hi> was well ended to the <hi>Southward,</hi> there was a freſh <hi>Alarm</hi> ſounded again to the <hi>Eastward,</hi> for on the <hi>eleventh of Auguſt,</hi> 1676. The very day before Philips heart (that had harboured ſo many <hi>miſchievous</hi> and <hi>Treacherovs devices</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was by one of his own Company <hi>ſhot through</hi>) did a party of Indians begin their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:171789:17"/>
               <hi>Outrages</hi> at <hi>Caſco</hi> in a moſt perfidious and treacherous manner, killing and carrying away Captive to the number of thirty perſons, and <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their houſes,</hi> amongſt whom was the Family of one <hi>Antony Brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et</hi> Inhabitant of <hi>Caſco,</hi> who was thought to have been killed, but he himſelf with his wife and one of his <hi>five Children</hi> carryed away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive with a <hi>Negro,</hi> did happily make an eſcape from their <hi>bloody</hi> and <hi>deceitful hands,</hi> In <hi>November</hi> next enſuing</p>
            <p>The manner how <hi>Antony Bracket</hi> and his wife made their eſcape was very <hi>remarkable,</hi> and therefore judged worthy to be inſerted here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though out of due place, the Indians that led them Captive, having brought them to the <hi>North ſide of Caſco Bay:</hi> News was brought to the ſaid Indians of the ſurprizal of <hi>Arowſick houſe in Kennibeck,</hi> withall the ſtore therein, which did ſo rejoyce them, that they made all haſte to ſhare in the good things there to be had. Thus eager to be gone they promiſed <hi>Bracket and his wife</hi> that they ſhould have alſo a ſhare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if they would make haſte after them, bringing along a burthen alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to each of them: The woman having a little before obſerved an <hi>old Burchin Canoo</hi> lying by the <hi>water ſide,</hi> hoped it was an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Providence offered for their eſcape; whereupon ſhe firſt prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asked of the Indians to let the <hi>Negro</hi> their own ſervant (at the ſame time carryed Captive by them) help them to carry their <hi>burthens,</hi> which was <hi>granted:</hi> then ſhe begged of them a piece or two of meat, which was not <hi>denyed them.</hi> Thus being furniſhed with help and proviſion, the <hi>Indians</hi> leaving them thus behinde to come after with their <hi>ſeveral burthens</hi> and a <hi>young Child;</hi> They could not but look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a <hi>nutus Divinus,</hi> to bid them, ſhift for themſelves: the woman alſo found a needle and thred in the houſe, where they ſtayd on that <hi>ſide of the Bay,</hi> with which having mended the <hi>Canoo,</hi> they ventured to get away; which proſperouſly ſucceeded: for in that <hi>old Canoo</hi> they croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a water <hi>eight or nine miles broad,</hi> and when they came on the <hi>South ſide of the Bay,</hi> they might have been in as much danger of other <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that had lately been about <hi>Black</hi> point, and had taken it; but they were newly gone: So things on all ſides thus concurring to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>their Deliverance,</hi> they came <hi>ſafely</hi> to the <hi>Fat</hi> at <hi>Black</hi> point, where alſo by ſpecial Providence they met with a <hi>Veſſel</hi> bound for <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cataqua,</hi> that came in to that <hi>Harbour,</hi> but a few hours before they came thither, by which means they <hi>Arrived ſafe in Paſcataqua</hi> River, ſoon after, all which Circumſtances are very worthy to be noted.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> that ſeized <hi>this Brackets Family,</hi> the chief was one <hi>Simond,</hi> that <hi>newly</hi> or a little before had eſcaped out of <hi>Dover

It is ſaid that coming to that <hi>Brackets houſe</hi> over night he pulled forth a <hi>counterfieted</hi> paſs, under the hands of ſome publick <hi>Officers,</hi> or men <hi>intruſted with that Service,</hi> making ſhew of all Friendſhip, but in the morning or ſoon after, he pulled off his <hi>Vizour</hi> of a <hi>friend,</hi> and diſcovered what he was, yet <hi>grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Life to this perſon and his Family, that did not, or could not reſiſt, which he denyed to ſome of the <hi>Neighbours</hi> not far off, who were many of them <hi>killed by this bloody <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illany,</hi> and his Partners.</p>
            <p>There are ſome <hi>Circumſtances</hi> in the Aſſault of <hi>Anthony Brackets</hi> houſe very conſiderable, which, becauſe it was the firſt <hi>Outrage</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Indians in this their <hi>ſecond Inſurrection,</hi> 1676. are worthy of a more particular remembring.</p>
            <p>This Indian forementioned called <hi>Simond,</hi> after he had eſcaped out of <hi>Priſon</hi> at <hi>Dover,</hi> came up to <hi>Gaſco,</hi> and either in the end of <hi>July,</hi> or beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> acquainted himſelf with this <hi>Antony Bracket,</hi> and oft frequented his houſe: Upon the <hi>ninth of August,</hi> ſome of the Indians having <hi>killed a Cow</hi> of his, the Indian <hi>Simond</hi> coming to his houſe promiſed to bring the Indians to him that had <hi>killed his Cow.</hi> In the mean time they of the place ſent two men to <hi>Major Walderns</hi> at <hi>Dover,</hi> to complain of this injury done by the Indians; but before their return, very <hi>early in the morning</hi> on the <hi>eleventh of Auguſt, Simond</hi> with a party of <hi>Indians</hi> came to <hi>Antony Brackets</hi> houſe, and told him there were the Indians that had <hi>killed his Cow;</hi> but as ſoon as they had ſaid that, the <hi>Indians</hi> went further into his houſe and took hold of all the <hi>Guns</hi> they could ſee, <hi>Antony Bracket</hi> asked what was the meaning of that, <hi>Simond</hi> preſently replyed, that ſo it <hi>muſt be,</hi> asking him withal, whether he had rather ſerve the <hi>Indians,</hi> or be <hi>ſlain by them, Antony Bracket</hi> Anſwered, that if the Caſe were ſo, he would rather chuſe to <hi>ſerve them,</hi> then be <hi>killed by them: Simond</hi> replyed, that then they muſt <hi>be bound,</hi> which preſently was done. The ſaid <hi>Bracket, his wife,</hi> and a <hi>Negro</hi> were <hi>all bound</hi> by the Indians, <hi>his wife</hi> had a <hi>Brother,</hi> who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſiſt was killed forthwith, the reſt with <hi>five Children</hi> were led away <hi>Priſoners.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:171789:18"/>Two hours after one <hi>Pike</hi> that lived not far off, but knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all this, went up in a <hi>Canoo</hi> toward one <hi>Robert Corbins</hi> houſe, where he found one <hi>Humphry Durham,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Atwel</hi> at work about their <hi>Hay,</hi> after a little ſtay, he left them intending to go up high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with his <hi>Canoo,</hi> but as ſoon as he was a little paſt, he heard <hi>Guns ſhot off,</hi> which made him with another man he had with him, preſently <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back;</hi> before he came beyond <hi>Corbins houſe</hi> he ſaw an <hi>Engliſh boy</hi> running with all haſte, which made him fear ſome miſchief was in hand, and preſently a <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olley of ſhot</hi> came againſt them, but the <hi>Bullets</hi> flying over their <hi>heads,</hi> did them no hurt: preſently <hi>Simond Indian</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and called them to <hi>come a ſhore;</hi> but they liked not his <hi>Courteſy,</hi> but preſently turning their <hi>Canoo</hi> into the ſtream got out of the reach of their Guns, haſting down to his <hi>own houſe</hi> with all ſpeed; when he came near to <hi>his houſe,</hi> he called to the <hi>People</hi> to make <hi>haſt away,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Garriſon houſe,</hi> and bid the reſt <hi>look to themſelves,</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Indians, that were coming againſt them: In the mean while, <hi>the Indians</hi> paſſing from <hi>Anthony Brackets</hi> to <hi>Corbins,</hi> killed <hi>Corbin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> with <hi>Humphry Durham,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Atwel</hi> forementioned: Then paſſing on to <hi>other houſes,</hi> carryed away ſome of them <hi>Captive,</hi> and <hi>killed</hi> others. At one of the next houſes, the <hi>women and Children</hi> got off into the <hi>water</hi> by a <hi>Canoo;</hi> but one <hi>James Roſs,</hi> his <hi>wife and Children</hi> were carryed away: <hi>Corbins wife</hi> with one of the other mens <hi>wives;</hi> and the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>another</hi> of them, they likewiſe carryed away.</p>
            <p>In another ſide of the Town, three were as they were going to <hi>reap at Antony Brackets,</hi> paſſing from an houſe where they left their <hi>Canoo,</hi> met with <hi>John Mount-joy</hi> and one <hi>Wakely,</hi> to whom they told what had hapned, ſoon after they heard two Guns ſhot of, whereby it ſeems <hi>two men</hi> were <hi>killed,</hi> wherefore coming back toward <hi>Thomas Brackets</hi> where they had left their <hi>Canoo,</hi> they ſaw him <hi>ſhot down</hi> by the Indians; one of the <hi>three</hi> not ſo well able <hi>to run</hi> hid himſelf in the buſhes in <hi>hope to make his eſcape</hi> more conveniently afterwards, which accordingly he did; but in the mean time he ſaw the Indians carry away <hi>Thomas Brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets wife and Children;</hi> Soon after the <hi>three men</hi> aforeſaid got ſafe to <hi>My. Mount joyes</hi> Garriſon, but not truſting to the Security of that Gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſon, they ſoon after repayred to an <hi>Iſland</hi> in the Bay, called <hi>James Andrew, Iſland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>George Lewes</hi> and <hi>his wife</hi> tarryed all this time in their houſe fill the next day, when they had opportunity to get ſafe to the <hi>Iſland</hi> aforeſaid, together with the <hi>two men</hi> that were now returned from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Waldern;</hi> whither they had been ſent, but <hi>too late,</hi> to make complaint
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:171789:19"/>
of the Indians that had <hi>counterfieted his paſs</hi> to travail into thoſe parts, and had done this miſchief.</p>
            <p>The day after one <hi>George Felt</hi> ſuſpecting the worſt by reaſon of a <hi>ſmoak,</hi> he ſaw on the <hi>oppoſite ſide of the Town,</hi> took his <hi>wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> into a <hi>Canoo</hi> to ſee what the <hi>matter was,</hi> but when he came near a <hi>point of Land</hi> not far off, he found ſeveral of his <hi>Neighbours goods</hi> which made him conclude their Owners <hi>were killed,</hi> which was a <hi>ſufficient warning</hi> to him likewiſe to <hi>fly for his Life,</hi> which he did to the <hi>ſame Iſland.</hi> After they had ſundry of them eſcaped thither, ſome of them remembred that they had <hi>left powder</hi> behind them in <hi>one or two places;</hi> whereupon they reſolved to venture a party of them in the night, partly to <hi>prvent the Indians</hi> from having any Advantage thereof, and partly for their <hi>own defence if occaſion ſhould be;</hi> Their Attempt ſucceeded well, for they brought away a <hi>barrel of powder</hi> from one <hi>Willes his houſe,</hi> and likewiſe a <hi>conſiderable quantity</hi> out of <hi>a Chest</hi> in a <hi>Store houſe,</hi> where the Indians had been <hi>ranſacking,</hi> &amp; had taken things out of the <hi>other end</hi> of the <hi>Cheſt,</hi> yet <hi>overlooked the Powder:</hi> In this ſurprizal of the <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> in <hi>Caſco Bay,</hi> called <hi>Falmouth,</hi> there were <hi>thirty four perſons kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and carryed Captive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this was not a caſual Attempt, but a <hi>deſigned plot,</hi> it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in that juſt about the very ſame time, the Indians at <hi>Kennibeck,</hi> made the <hi>like Inſurrection,</hi> whereby it is concluded, either that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians which eſcaped from <hi>Dover,</hi> ſtirred them up thereunto, or elſe that the ſaid Indians finding them in a <hi>diſpoſition tending that way,</hi> by reaſon of ſome injuries done them that dwell farther <hi>Northward,</hi> they offered their Service to <hi>help forward</hi> the deſigne.</p>
            <p>It is to be noted here, that the Indians about <hi>Kennibeck</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to continue their former <hi>amity</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the report of <hi>Philips riſing that year before,</hi> and the <hi>Outrages</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the <hi>laſt Autumne,</hi> and <hi>winter</hi> following, yet which is more, they had lately <hi>renewed their League</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in thoſe parts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had often complained to thoſe of <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> of the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they ſuffered, in the withholding from them the <hi>Trade of Powder,</hi> and <hi>ſhot,</hi> without which they ſaid they cannot <hi>ſubſiſt,</hi> and for want of which it is alleadged by themſelves, that ſome of them <hi>periſhed</hi> the laſt <hi>Winter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Quarrel</hi> of late <hi>fallen out</hi> betwixt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans about <hi>Kennibeck,</hi> and <hi>Eaſtward</hi> thereof, being a matter of <hi>great Conſequence;</hi> For the farther ſatisfaction of the Reader, it ſhall in what follows, be more <hi>particularly deſcribed;</hi> It being the duty of every one

that <hi>publiſheth thing's</hi> of this nature, to to do the <hi>right of an Hiſtorian</hi> to all ſorts of <hi>perſons,</hi> any way concerned in what is <hi>made publick;</hi> The Information was received from a <hi>prudent perſon,</hi> an <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Ear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of all that hapned amongſt the ſaid Indians, both the <hi>former</hi> and preſent <hi>year,</hi> and one that was of more <hi>publick Concernment</hi> in <hi>thoſe Tranſactions</hi> then ſome others, therefore may the more heed be given thereto.

            <p>But the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> told them, in Caſe they would not come down, and deliver up their Arms, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would kill them. <hi>He that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a Meſſage by the hand of a Fool</hi> ſaith Solomon, <hi>cutteth off the feet, and drinketh dammage;</hi> This Meſſage was delivered by him that went, as was <hi>confeſſed</hi> by himſelf, who put it into his mouth, or whether it was <hi>devized</hi> in his <hi>own heart,</hi> it concerns not us now to enquire, but the <hi>dammage</hi> that ſide of the Country hath been made to <hi>drink thereby,</hi> is not eaſy to <hi>recount;</hi> for upon this <hi>Threatning Meſſage</hi> the Indians <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook</hi> their <hi>Fort</hi> preſently, and went <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> and ſent abroad to <hi>Johns River</hi> and to the <hi>Sea ſide</hi> to get all the Indians they could together to come up <hi>Penobſcot River.</hi>

            <p>A <hi>Gentleman</hi> who at that time lived at <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> a kind of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent</hi> over the Affairs of that place, conſidering the <hi>ſad ſtate</hi> things were running into, laboured to <hi>obtain a Parly</hi> with the ſaid Indians, or ſome of them, which after much trouble and coſt, he did accompliſh.

               <hi>Powder and Shot,</hi> and ſaid they would kill any Indian they met; others at <hi>Monhiggan</hi> offered <hi>five pound</hi> for every Indian that ſhould be brought, yet would not theſe perſons that were <hi>ſo violent</hi> againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in their diſcourſe, be perſwaded upon any Terms, then, or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to <hi>go out to fight againſt</hi> the Indians in an <hi>orderly way;</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared both by their Security in not <hi>standing better upon their guard,</hi> and by their <hi>ſudden flight</hi> afterward, running away like a <hi>Flock of Sheep,</hi> at the <hi>barking</hi> of any <hi>little dog:</hi> Things being in this <hi>poſture,</hi> what could be expected but a <hi>preſent warr</hi> with the Indians, although as it ſeems, there were few or none like to be found, willing to undertake it, or fit to manage it in thoſe parts.

            <p>When the <hi>foreſaid Exploits</hi> were done by the Indians in and about <hi>Caſco Bay,</hi> ſeveral of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> removed to <hi>Jewels Iſland,</hi> where they hoped to be <hi>more ſecure</hi> from the Indians, but their barbarous Enemy finding ſo <hi>little Reſiſtance</hi> made againſt them <hi>on the main Land,</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable party of them came <hi>with their Canoos</hi> to deſtroy that <hi>Iſland</hi> alſo, about <hi>three weeks</hi> after the forementioned miſchiefs.</p>

            <p>The Indians growing more bold by theſe Attempts in thoſe remote places, drew down nearer towards <hi>Paſcataqua,</hi> for not long after a party
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:171789:25"/>
of them came upon <hi>Cape Nidduck,</hi> where they <hi>killed and carryed away</hi> all the Inhabitants of a few ſcattering houſes, to the number of <hi>ſeven in all,</hi> and ſuch was their <hi>Salvage Cruelty exerciſed</hi> in this place, as is not uſually heard of, for having <hi>daſhed out the brains of a poor woman that gave ſuck,</hi> they <hi>nayled the young Child</hi> to the <hi>dead body of its mother,</hi> which was found ſucking in that <hi>rueful manner,</hi> when the People came to the place. The day before a man and his wife were killed by them at <hi>Wells,</hi> and two men more ſoon after. On the <hi>twelfth of October</hi> following near <hi>an hundred</hi> of the Indians made an Aſſault upon <hi>Black point,</hi> all the Inhabitants being gathered into <hi>one fortifyed place</hi> upon that point, which a few hands might have defended againſt all the Indians on that <hi>ſide of the Country.</hi> But as it ſeems, one called <hi>Mugg</hi> was the Leader of the Indians; one that had from a <hi>Child</hi> been well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and had lived ſome years in Engliſh Families, who though a <hi>cunning Fellow,</hi> and had prevailed much in his Attempts, yet at this time ſhewed more Courteſy to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> then according to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Outrages could be expected from any of thoſe <hi>barbarous miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants;</hi> and was willing to make offer of <hi>a Treaty</hi> to <hi>Mr. Joſſelin,</hi> chief of the Garriſon, to whom the ſaid <hi>Mugg</hi> promiſed liberty for all that were there, to depart with their goods upon the <hi>ſurrender of the place:</hi> The ſaid <hi>Joſſelin</hi> reports, that when he came back from his treating with <hi>Mugg,</hi> that all the People were fled away out of the Garriſon, having carryed away their goods by water before his return, in ſo much that having none but his <hi>Houſehold Servants</hi> to ſtand by him, he was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make no Reſiſtance, and ſo <hi>ſurrendred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When People have once <hi>been frighted</hi> with Reports and Senſe of danger, they are ready to <hi>fly away</hi> like a <hi>Hart</hi> before the <hi>Hunter</hi> or his <hi>Hounds,</hi> one of the Inhabitants of the place affirmed he ſaw <hi>an hundred and fifty</hi> Indians, which was more by <hi>an hundred</hi> than any body elſe ever ſaw near the Fort. But when a place is <hi>deſigned to Ruine,</hi> every thing they take in hand ſhall tend that way.</p>
            <p>The loſs of <hi>Black point</hi> was accompanyed with another ſad Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>fell out</hi> about the ſame time at <hi>Richmonds Iſland.</hi> For young <hi>Mr. Fryer</hi> with ſome others at <hi>Paſcataqua,</hi> to whom it ſeemed grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous that the Indians ſhould make <hi>all that Spoyle</hi> in every place in thoſe <hi>farther Plantations,</hi> ventured upon the great Importunity of <hi>Mr. Shendal,</hi> with a <hi>Ketch</hi> to try what they could ſave of ſuch things that the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had left. But things were ſo ordered, that before they had <hi>laden their Ketch,</hi> coming too near the <hi>Stage head,</hi> they preſently found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in danger of a <hi>ſurprizal,</hi> for part of their Company being a

ſhore, were <hi>ſeized</hi> by the Indians, or in <hi>danger thereof,</hi> whom they were not willing to leave behind; and beſides the wind blowing in hard upon them, they could not <hi>get out of the Harbour,</hi> but were forced to abide the danger of an Aſſault. The Indians getting many of them into the <hi>ſtage head</hi> annoyed them ſo faſt with their <hi>ſhot,</hi> that not a man of them was able to look <hi>above deck,</hi> but he was in danger of being <hi>ſhot down,</hi> amongſt the reſt <hi>Mr. James Fryer</hi> venturing too much <hi>in view</hi> of the Enemy received <hi>a wound</hi> in his <hi>knee,</hi> which <hi>appeared</hi> not <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi> at the firſt, but for want of <hi>better looking to,</hi> then could be found amongſt that <hi>black Regiment,</hi> into whoſe hands he ſoon after fell; It <hi>proved Mortal unto him,</hi> within a <hi>few dayes after:</hi> he being by a <hi>ſtrange Accident</hi> brought home to his <hi>Fathers houſe</hi> at the great <hi>Iſland</hi> in <hi>Paſcataqua. Mr. Fryer</hi> being thus wounded, the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany defended themſelves for a while with much Courage and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, till they were brought to the ſad choice of <hi>falling into the hands</hi> of one of theſe three bad Maſters, the Fire, the water, or the <hi>Barbarous Heathen,</hi> to whom at laſt they thought it beſt to yield, in hope of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty afterwards, at leaſt of lengthning out their lives a little longer, for the Indians had <hi>manned</hi> out a <hi>Canoo</hi> with ſeveral hands to <hi>cut their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and others ſtood ready within the defence of the ſtage head to fire upon any one that ſtirred in the <hi>Ketch,</hi> by which means the Veſſel after the Cable was cut ſoon drave a ſhore; and then was it threatned to be preſently burned, if they did not all yield, to which they all at laſt conſented.</p>
            <p>The Indians how barbarous ſoever in their own nature, yet civilly intreated their Priſoners, and upon farther diſcourſe ſent one or two of them to <hi>Paſcataqua,</hi> to give them there an opportunity <hi>to Ranſome</hi> their Friends. The perſons ſent home to procure a Ranſome, were to return with ſuch a quantity of goods as the Indians had deſired; by ſuch a preciſe time: but they that brought the things for their Ranſome, coming a day or two before the time, when thoſe that ſent them were gone up the River at <hi>Black point,</hi> and not returned: Some other Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans waiting for ſuch an opportunity <hi>ſeized the goods,</hi> at leaſt that part which they moſt deſired, and through miſtake, killing one of the three men hat brought them, dismiſſed the other two, without return of the Priſoners as was expected.</p>
            <p>As to what hapned afterward, we are yet much in the dark, and for the preſent can write but by gueſs: for within a few dayes after the return of <hi>Mr. Shendal,</hi> and the other man that went to carry the Ranſome, before <hi>November 1.

bringing <hi>Mr. James Fryer,</hi> who ſoon after dyed of his wound, one of the Priſoners along with him complaining that <hi>without his knowledge</hi> ſome of the Indians had ſeized what was ſent for the <hi>Ranſome</hi> of the reſt, promiſing upon <hi>his Faith,</hi> that he would make good his word for the ſending home all the Priſoners, and offered alſo in the Name of the other Indians, to confirm a <hi>new Peace</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: The <hi>Major General</hi> of the <hi>Maſſachuſets Colony</hi> was then at <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cataqua,</hi> but not willing to <hi>Transact</hi> a matter of that nature and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by his <hi>ſole Authority,</hi> ordered the ſaid <hi>Mugg</hi> (ſuppoſed to be the <hi>chief Leader</hi> of the Indians) to be carryed down to <hi>Boſton</hi> to <hi>the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Councel there,</hi> to conclude the buſineſs, with whom he ſoon after agreed upon a <hi>firm Peace</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> in the Name of <hi>Madockawando,</hi> the chief of all the Indians <hi>in the Eaſtern parts</hi> about <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> engaging alſo to remain himſelf, as <hi>hoſtage</hi> aboard the <hi>

            <p>There are two <hi>principal Actors</hi> amongſt the Indians that have all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long promoted theſe deſignes amongſt them, one named <hi>Squando, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamore of Saco,</hi> and the forementioned <hi>Madockawando,</hi> the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Indians <hi>Eaſtward</hi> about <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> who are ſaid to be, by them that know them, a <hi>ſtrange kind</hi> of <hi>moralized Salvages. Grave and Serious</hi> in their Speech and Carriage, and not without ſome ſhew of a <hi>kind of Religion,</hi> which no doubt but they have learned from <hi>the Prince of darkneſs,</hi> (by the help of ſome papiſt in thoſe parts) that can <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf into an Angel of Light;</hi> under that ſhape, the better to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the deſignes of his Kingdome.

            <p>It is reported by ſome that came lately from thoſe parts, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians there do as yet refuſe to have any peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and will not as yet return any of our Captive Friends, till God ſpeak to the foreſaid <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> that are <hi>their Leaders,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>no longer</hi> make <hi>warr with us,</hi> and the like.</p>

            <p>In the next place it remains, that ſome account be given of <hi>our Forces</hi> under <hi>Captain Hathorne,</hi> and of their <hi>ſeveral Expeditions</hi> into the <hi>Eaſtern parts,</hi> ſince the middle of <hi>September laſt;</hi> firſt up toward <hi>Caſco,</hi> by the <hi>Sea-ſide,</hi> then afterwards <hi>through the woods</hi> directly <hi>Northward,</hi> toward <hi>Oſſapy,</hi> and <hi>Pigwauchet,</hi> in hope to have found the Enemy there at their <hi>head Quarters.</hi>

            <p>Nor could <hi>our Forces</hi> in all <hi>their Expedition</hi> meet with any of them, but <hi>two;</hi> one of which ſoon after he was taken, was let goe, by the <hi>Treachery</hi> or <hi>Careleſsneſs</hi> of them that held him. For when our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were come within a <hi>few miles</hi> of the hither ſide of <hi>Caſco Bay,</hi> ſome of our <hi>Natick Indian Scouts</hi> going in Company with the Indians under <hi>Blind Will,</hi> (a <hi>Sagamore</hi> of <hi>Paſcataqua,</hi> who went in Company with eight of his men, ſuppoſed to be <hi>good Pilots</hi> for the places more <hi>East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>) met with ſome of the Enemy, and laid hold of <hi>a couple</hi> of them; <hi>Juſtice</hi> was done upon <hi>one of them,</hi> the other, although he was led by two of <hi>Blind Wills Indians,</hi> they made a ſhift to <hi>let goe,</hi> who eſcaping away, got over a River, and gave notice to the Indians who were on the other ſide, &amp; were heard but a little before <hi>threſhing in a Barne</hi> that belonged to one <hi>Anthony Bracket,</hi> (whom they had lately ſurprized) Another diſappointment our Forces met withal about the ſame time, for when <hi>Captain Hathorne</hi> was up at <hi>Caſco Bay</hi> with his Souldiers, he n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>ſpecial hand of Divine Juſtice,</hi> ſuffered to fall, by ſome of <hi>our Forces:</hi> He was a <hi>very luſty, stout man,</hi> and one that was armed with <hi>ſeveral ſorts of Weapons,</hi> but there is no <hi>Weapon</hi> ſhall defend them, whom death hath a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to deſtroy: There is no <hi>Ranſome in that War:</hi> The reſt of the Indians that were ſcattered about <hi>Caſco Bay,</hi> having diſcovered our Forces, made their eſcape: But, we hope their time is ſhort, and that God will find ſome way to cut off the <hi>bloody</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Enemies</hi> of his People, and not ſuffer them to <hi>live out half their dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by one ſuch Accident or other; <hi>our Souldiers</hi> could not meet with any of them that had done all the miſchief about thoſe parts And while out Forces lay about <hi>Caſco Bay;</hi> A ſmall party of the Enemy came down upon the Borders of the Town of <hi>Wells,</hi> where they <hi>lay in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh</hi> near a Garriſon houſe, at one end of the Town, and ſhot down <hi>Mr. James Gouge</hi> from his horſe, <hi>September the twenty fourth,</hi> being <hi>Lords day,</hi> as he was going home from <hi>the Meeting;</hi> and then <hi>knocked down his wife,</hi> giving her ſeveral wounds with their Hatchets about the head, of which ſhe dyed within three dayes after.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>September the twenty fifth,</hi> the ſame party being not above <hi>ſeven</hi> in number went toward <hi>Yorke,</hi> and ſurprized <hi>Cape Nid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duck</hi> in a barbarous manner, killing moſt of the poor people belonging thereunto: Some of their Neighbours hearing of the Guns, came to <hi>their Reſcue:</hi> The Indians being on the further ſide of a River, dared them to come over and <hi>fight with them man to man:</hi> uſing ſeveral Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tearms to them, making a Shot at them alſo, which ſome of the Company not being able to bear, did <hi>very reſolutely adventure</hi> through the River after them; but they were not willing to <hi>try the valour</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> when they perceived they <hi>found a way</hi> to paſs over the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver upon them,</hi> but returned back towards <hi>Wells;</hi> where they killed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one <hi>George Farrow, September the twenty ſeventh,</hi> as he was too careleſsly venturing to his houſe without any Company: Theſe things hapned while our Forces were at <hi>Caſco,</hi> where they tarryed ſeven or eight dayes. And hearing of theſe Outrages committed in ſome of thoſe places which they left behind them; and not being able to meet with any of them in the place where they were, they returned back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Wells,</hi> and <hi>Yorke;</hi> but the Indians were eſcaped away into the woods after their Companions, before they came there: Our Souldiers having thus ſpent much time and pains in a fruitleſs Expedition toward <hi>Caſco,</hi> they reſolved to venture <hi>another march</hi> after them, up towards <hi>Oſſapy,</hi> ſuppoſing they might by that time be drawn homewards toward

their <hi>Winter Quarters;</hi> or elſe, that they might deſtroy what they had left behind them, to <hi>prevent their harbouring there</hi> for the future: But it ſeemed good to him, who by his Sovereign Power and Infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ordereth all Events and purpoſes (wherein his People or others are concerned) to <hi>diſappoint all endeavours</hi> uſed at that time for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of the Enemy, or putting any ſtop to their wonted Succeſſes: For ſoon after our Forces were returned back from <hi>Caſco,</hi> news was brought of the <hi>ſurprizal</hi> of <hi>Black point,</hi> on the <hi>twelfth of October,</hi> as was mentioned before; which notwithſtanding; It was judged more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable to venture and proceed on with the Expedition toward <hi>Oſſapy,</hi> (whether it was ſuppoſed by this time, the greateſt number of them were retired) rather then to return back again to recover <hi>Black point,</hi> where was nothing to be expected but an empty Fort, and ſome deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed houſes, which it ſeems the Indians had forſaken by that time.</p>
            <p>And beſides that other <hi>Forces</hi> were about the ſame time ordered to <hi>repair</hi> thither, ſufficient for the repairing &amp; ſecuring of the place with what elſe was left remaining from the hands of the <hi>Enemy;</hi> And likewiſe ſeveral Souldiers were ordered to Garriſon the Towns thereabouts, to prevent them from making any further Aſſault upon them. However, they were ſo far emboldned by the taking of <hi>black point,</hi> and the <hi>Ketch</hi> at <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Iſland</hi> with ſeveral Priſoners alſo which were ſurprized at the ſame time; That a party of them came the very next week after, toward <hi>Wells,</hi> hoping to attain that, and all the Towns, and places elſe betwixt <hi>Caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This was all the miſchief was done by them, after the taking of <hi>Black point:</hi> The Inhabitants of <hi>Winter Harbour,</hi> near adjoyning thereto, being alarmed with the ſurprizal of the other place; fled away with <hi>their goods,</hi> for a time; till they heard the Enemies were removed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> and then it was ſaid, they returned to their place again; In this poſture have things in thoſe places remained ever ſince, in thoſe <hi>Eaſtern Plantations</hi> betwixt <hi>Paſcataqua</hi> and <hi>Caſco Bay.</hi>

            <p>But our Forces under the Command of <hi>Captain Hathorne,</hi> and <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Syl,</hi> having at the laſt obtained all things neceſſary for a <hi>Winter march</hi> into the woods, did upon the <hi>firſt of November</hi> following, ſet forth toward <hi>Oſſapy,</hi> where, after <hi>four dayes march</hi> of very <hi>difficult way,</hi> over many Rivers, not eaſy to paſs at that time of the year, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; but found <hi>never an Indian,</hi> either there, or in the way, as they marched along: The Indians belonging to thoſe parts, had not many years before hired ſome <hi>Engliſh Traders</hi> to build them a <hi>Fort,</hi> for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> which was built <hi>very ſtrong</hi> for that purpoſe <hi>fourteen Foot</hi> high with <hi>Flankers</hi> at each corner. But at this time the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers <hi>intending to diſappoint them</hi> of <hi>their Refuge,</hi> made <hi>Fuel thereof,</hi> which at that time was very <hi>needful for our People,</hi> who had marched many miles <hi>through deep Snow</hi> in a very <hi>cold Seaſon,</hi> when they could hardly keep themſelves from <hi>freezing</hi> as they paſſed along, ſo early in the <hi>Winter:</hi> None of the Enemy being to be found there in their <hi>ſtrongeſt Fort;</hi> It was not counted worth the while for all the Company to <hi>march any farther:</hi> Wherefore a ſmall party being ſent up <hi>eighteen or twenty miles</hi> farther <hi>Northward</hi> amongſt the woods, whereas they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed along they met with many <hi>vast Lakes,</hi> (ſuppoſed to be the Cauſe of the <hi>ſharpneſs of the cold,</hi> in that ſide of the Country) making the place <hi>ſcarce habitable</hi> for any beſides thoſe <hi>Salvages</hi> that uſe to <hi>hunt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,</hi> for <hi>Mooſe</hi> in the <hi>Winter,</hi> and <hi>Beaver</hi> in the <hi>Summer,</hi> (a ſort of Creatures, whoſe Skins are of more Account than all their bodies.) But at this time it is ſuppoſed they were all gone lower toward the Sea ſide, <hi>to ſhare the Spoyls</hi> of the Engliſh Plantations, lately ſurprized by them; which is all the <hi>Reward</hi> they have met withal, who in former years, for the ſake of a little Lucre by Traffick with them, have run themſelves there into the very <hi>Jaws of deſtruction,</hi> either by Irregular dealing with them; or by their too much confidence in their <hi>deceitful Friendſhip.</hi>

            <p>There was great probability that the deſigne might have had ſome good Effect, if <hi>Mugg</hi> a <hi>chief Leader</hi> of them, did not much abuſe thoſe he fled unto, with a <hi>proffer of Peace;</hi> for he told them that there were about an hundred of them about <hi>Oſſapy,</hi> not many dayes before: But it becomes us to look beyond <hi>ſecond Cauſes,</hi> in Events of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and conclude, that <hi>God had raiſed up</hi> theſe Barbarous Enemies to bring <hi>a like Chaſtiſement</hi> upon the Engliſh in this <hi>ſide of the Country,</hi> with that which others had endured elſewhere, in the end of the former, and beginning of this preſent year.</p>

            <p>Things were ſo ordered by the <hi>good Providence of God,</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Veſſels</hi> arrived ſafely at <hi>Penobſcot</hi> in the beginning of the next month, where they found the ſaid <hi>Madockawando,</hi> who was ready to confirm and make good the <hi>Articles of the Peace</hi> concluded at <hi>Boſton</hi> by his <hi>Agent</hi> in his Name; And was willing alſo to deliver all <hi>the Priſoners</hi> that were then in <hi>his Power,</hi> or under his <hi>Command,</hi> which were but <hi>two,</hi> who were taken in the Veſſel at <hi>Richmonds Iſland,</hi> the <hi>twelfth of October</hi> laſt.

            </p>
            <p>The manner of <hi>his eſcape,</hi> as he reports was this: He was imployed by the Indians to <hi>threſh Corn</hi> at a <hi>Barn</hi> a little lower in <hi>the River,</hi> than the place where the Indians <hi>commonly kept</hi> being truſted <hi>alone,</hi> to <hi>go</hi> and <hi>come</hi> of <hi>himſelf,</hi> becauſe there was no <hi>ſuspition</hi> of any coming to carry him away, or <hi>ſeeming poſſibility</hi> to get away without being <hi>diſcovered,</hi> he found means to plot with another <hi>young man,</hi> who was ſent to <hi>look hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> whoſe <hi>fleſh</hi> it ſeems is by thoſe <hi>wild Salvages,</hi> preferred before the <hi>beſt Beef,</hi> ſo as having their <hi>choice of both,</hi> they took what they <hi>liked beſt;</hi> And this being the Imployment of the <hi>young man,</hi> he had the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opportunity when he was in <hi>the woods</hi> to make any <hi>Contrivance</hi> to get away. Thus being reſolved upon their deſigne, they <hi>provided ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries accordingly,</hi> and ſent ſuch a Meſſage home to <hi>their Maesters,</hi> as might occaſion them not to expect them very ſoon that night; Thus reſolved, they <hi>marched away,</hi> as ſoon as ever they perceived the <hi>Coaſt was clear;</hi> And having provided a <hi>Canoo</hi> accordingly fit for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, by the help of it they got over the waters, by which they were to paſs which were <hi>not frozen;</hi> And in the <hi>night time</hi> turned into a <hi>Swampe,</hi> where they might <hi>make a fire</hi> to keep them from <hi>ſtarving with the Cold,</hi> without being diſcerned; So as within <hi>two or three dayes</hi> they recovered the <hi>Fort,</hi> and <hi>Garriſon</hi> at <hi>black point,</hi> from whence they were ſoon conveighed to <hi>Boſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Francis Card</hi> made this Relation of matters when he came to <hi>Boston, viz.</hi> that the Priſoners which he left behind <hi>were well,</hi> and not <hi>much miſuſed,</hi> only put to do the <hi>Servile work</hi> about the Indians: woe muſt it needs be with <hi>Christians,</hi> when put not only <hi>to ſojourne,</hi> but to ſerve in thoſe <hi>Tents of Kedar.</hi> Such of <hi>the women</hi> as were <hi>gifted</hi> at

            <p>He reported alſo that the Indians <hi>ſpake nothing of any Peace;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being <hi>heightned</hi> with their <hi>late and great Succeſſes,</hi> were <hi>contriving</hi> how to <hi>get poſſeſſion</hi> of the <hi>other places</hi> in the hands of the Engliſh, on that ſide of the <hi>Country,</hi> which <hi>God forbid ſhould ever come to paſs;</hi> but finding ſo <hi>eaſy work</hi> of their <hi>former Exploits,</hi> they hope they ſhall <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh their purpoſes</hi> with the <hi>like facility</hi> in all other places where they come.</p>
            <p>It ſeems <hi>Squando</hi> is their <hi>chief Leader,</hi> that <hi>Enthuſiaſtical,</hi> or rather <hi>Diabolical Miſcreant;</hi> who yet hath put on a <hi>garbe of Religion,</hi> and orders his People to do the like; performing <hi>Religious worſhip</hi> amongſt the Indians <hi>in his way,</hi> yet is ſuppoſed to have very <hi>familiar Converſe with the Devil,</hi> that appears to him as <hi>an Angel of Light</hi> in ſome <hi>ſhape</hi> or other very frequently.

Some <hi>prudent Gentlemen</hi> that <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Virginia</hi> at the firſt, were aware of this miſchief; wherefore it was ſtrictly forbidden them, upon <hi>pain of death</hi> to ſhew an Indian the <hi>uſe of a Gun;</hi> if the like Courſe had been continued here, it had ſcarce been poſſible according to the <hi>Eye of Reaſon</hi> that ſo much miſchief could have been done us by our Indian Neighbours, at this time more than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer years. Their wills were as good heretofore, but when they had nothing but <hi>Bows and Arrows</hi> to truſt unto, they were capable of no ſuch miſchief: But now by their <hi>frequent Converſe</hi> and <hi>Trading</hi> with the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> on each ſide of us, they are as well skil'd in the uſe of <hi>ſmall Artillery</hi> as many other Nations.</p>

               <p>This Story is reported by <hi>Major Waldern, Mr. Joſhuah Moodey, Captain Froſt,</hi> that live upon, or near the place.

               </p>
               <p>For the actings of our <hi>Neighbour Nations</hi> round about us, whether they have had <hi>actually any hand</hi> in our Sufferings, either <hi>inſtigating</hi> of our Enemies, or ſecretly and underhand ſupplying them with neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries where with to carry on their deſigne againſt us, without <hi>whoſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,</hi> it is ſuppoſed they could hardly thus long have <hi>held out.</hi> It is no queſtion but there are thoſe in the world, that ſay <hi>Aha, at the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of our Sion,</hi> and that like <hi>Edom in Jeruſalems day,</hi> cry, <hi>Raſe it, Raſe it, even to the Foundation thereof:</hi> But for our near Neighbours, whether <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> their deſigne in their ſeveral Plantations, being <hi>ſolely,</hi> or <hi>principally Trade,</hi> and knowing that as <hi>formerly they had,</hi> ſo may they <hi>still have</hi> more benefit, and <hi>Advantage</hi> by our <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Traffick</hi> than by our Ruine; it ſeems therefore not ſo <hi>probable,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>promote</hi> or <hi>deſigne</hi> ſuch a <hi>wicked end</hi> to themſelves, much leſs that they ſhould <hi>joyne</hi> with <hi>Pagan Infidels</hi> therein; more <hi>Charity</hi> we judge is due to them that <hi>profeſs the Chriſtian Name,</hi> whatever <hi>Errour</hi> or <hi>Superſtition</hi> their Religion or worſhip may be blinded with</p>
               <p>We may well conceive that <hi>either of them</hi> would not be much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to part with any thing they have to ſell for <hi>Beaver,</hi> nor would they very ſcrupulouſly enquire what the Indians do with their <hi>Powder,</hi> provided they could get their <hi>pay for it,</hi> no more than the Cutler did, to know (as the Tale goes) what the Cutpurſe did with the knife he made him: But that purpoſely either of them have furniſhed our Enemies with means to do us miſchief, we are not <hi>forward to believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Cannada</hi> they live at <hi>too great</hi> a diſtance, to have much <hi>Commerce</hi> with our Enemies: And beſides they are not themſelves ſo ſecure of the Indians they deal with as to be <hi>forward</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Other Reports poſſibly have been taken up concerning us, as if we were <hi>divided in our Counſels,</hi> and were too tenacious of our goods, and readier to keep them for our Enemies, than prudently to lay out what was neceſſary for our own defence and preſervation: no queſtion but many ſuch Rumours as theſe have taken place, in the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the laſt place, upon the conſideration of theſe late <hi>

It may probably be ſuppoſed, that the <hi>pious endeavours</hi> of ſome to preach the Goſpel amongſt ſeveral of the <hi>Indian Natives,</hi> hath given the firſt occaſion of the Quarrel, as uſually it hath done in the world, But that Oppoſition meeting with no <hi>better Succeſs</hi> in the <hi>Southern parts,</hi> than the Ruine of thoſe that made the <hi>firſt Rebellion</hi> againſt us, Satan hath lately <hi>changed himſelf into an Angel of Light,</hi> under that ſhape, making this his <hi>laſt Attempt,</hi> to the <hi>Eaſtward.</hi>

For the chief Leader of thoſe Indians is a <hi>Sagamore</hi> called <hi>Squando,</hi> who hath (as is ſaid by them that lately eſcaped from their hands <hi>familiar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the Prince of Darkneſs,</hi> though under the notion of a <hi>good Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> putting him upon a <hi>form of Religion,</hi> and forbidding any <hi>acts of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty</hi> and <hi>murther</hi> to be uſed againſt any they oppoſe, if they be <hi>willing to yield,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> that way promiſing <hi>great Succeſs to his Followers,</hi> what the Iſſues of his proceedings will be, God only knows, and a little time may diſcover. But for thoſe that before theſe troubles have <hi>profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owned the Chriſtian Name,</hi> many of them have given <hi>notable proof</hi> of their <hi>ſincerity,</hi> by fighting againſt their, and our Enemies, and have been very succeſsful in their Endeavours: as well theſe in the <hi>upper parts of Cape-God,</hi> commonly called <hi>Cape Indians.</hi> as thoſe about <hi>Natick,</hi> and <hi>Haſſinameſet,</hi> within the <hi>Maſſachuſet Jurisdiction.</hi> It is not my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to enlarge much on this hand, that I might not raiſe the expectation of the world to greater matters than for the preſent do appear.</p>
               <p>There are about <hi>ſix Societies of Indians</hi> in the Country, who have <hi>profeſſedly owned themſelves Chriſtians;</hi> In every one of which it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed there are ſome, that do make <hi>a ſerious profeſſion</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion.
